%% Structure
%the codes for the methods false position, Ridder's and Fixed point 
%are written as functions in files with their respective names.
%All task_*.m are excutable and show the results asked by each
%respective task.

%% Function
%our function is f(x) = log(x) + cos(x) - 1,
%the function is undefined at f(0); log(0) is undefined.
%Also if domain of f(x) is all the real numbers except zero,
%then the range of f will contain complex valued numbers.
%so we restrict our domain to (0 , inf).
