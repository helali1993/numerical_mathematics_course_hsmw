%% README
%
% Each task has one script with all required cases, 
% and other scripts divided by case. 
%  
%% Task 1: Lorenz System 
%  
% We divide task 1 into two examples and one major script.
% Example 1 is the Chaiotic behaviour case,
% Example 2 is the Stable with fixed points case.
% Each example has three plots, one for our Implementation,
% one for the Builtin results, and the last one to compare them both.
% The major script has six plots; three for each example.
%
%% Task 2: Wave Equation
%
% We divide task 2 into 4 examples and one major script.
% Example 1 and 2 satisfy the stability conditions.
% Example 3 and 4 don't.
% Each example produces one animation displaying the wave amplitude.
% For the major script, the four animations will play after each other
% automatically. 
%
% If it is preferred that the next animation plays when the
% current one closes, it is provided in the major script how to do so.
% (eg: changing the following line of code: 
%  movie(F,1,1) => movie(F,temporal_divs_ex1,10)).
% These are at lines 90, 182, 266, 352.
