% The following are the written functions to perform the tasks.
% lu_decomposition(A) performs LU decomposition.
% check_lu_unique(A, bool) checks whether the LU decomposition is unique.
% cholesky_decomposition performs the Cholesky decomposition.
% gauss_seidl(A, B, numIter) performs the Gauss Seidel iterative mehtod.
% Gram_Schmidt(A) performs the QR decompostion.
% RandOrthMat(n, tol) generates a random n x n orthogonal real matrix.

% As for the tasks, each task has its own runnable file.
% for example:  Task 1.3 is Task_1_3 and so on.
